    Make an extension function on a Vector2 which returns a random value between x & y
    Make an extension function of rigidbody that given a float arguement, clamps speed at that threshold
    Make an extension function that given a string array & label, returns a single string formated like:
        label: elem1,elem2,elem3
    Make an extension function same as above, but works on an array of any type
    Make an extension function that mimics how .Contains works  
    Make an extension function that runs a predicate on each element and returns if it is true for all elements
    Make an extension function that runs a delegate on a collection of type T, and returns a collection of type G
        Examples:
            Vector3[] velocitiesOfEachRb = arrayOfRigidbodiesIHave.CollectionFrom((rb)=>{ return rb.velocity;});
            Vector3[] positionsOfGameObjects = arrayOfGameObjects.CollectionFrom((go)=>{ return go.position;});

    /*
     Examples shown in class
     An extension function that returns the average of a vector3
     An extension function that absolutes all values in an int array
     An extension function of rigidbody that given a float arguement, returns if speed is above that threshold
     Our own Contains function
     An extension function that runs a delegate on each element in an int array and replaces the int
     An extension function that extends type T array and randomizes the array
