Create a multi-threaded brute force program that attempts to guess the password and robs the bank.
Everytime the bank is robbed, the password is reset.
Keep robbing the bank until it runs out of money (returns -1).
Output the time taken with a System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch
Your brute force robber is allowed access to knowing the length of the password


Your bank robber will be raced against others using the average value of 3 runs for passwords of lengths 1->6
Start with smaller passwords of size 2~4. A password of size 6 if not fully optimized may take 20 minutes~several hours.


Outputting the guess is useful just for debugging. It is an incredible expensive operation and will slow down
your algo alot. In the final test it does not need to be active, but use it for testing.
